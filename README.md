Power BI to Fabric Migration Tool Overview This is a web application, built using Streamlit, designed to simplify and automate the process of migrating data source configurations from a legacy Power BI environment to a new Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse or a general SQL Database. It provides a simple, graphical interface for one of the most critical steps in the migration: mapping your original Power BI data source files (which represent datasets or dataflows) to the new target tables in your Fabric-compatible SQL environment. This tool is intended to help organizations transition smoothly from the older Power BI Premium SKUs to the modern, unified Azure-based Fabric capacity (F SKUs). Key Features Web-Based Interface: It’s a clean, interactive app thanks to Streamlit. File Discovery: It automatically scans a local folder you specify to find the source files that need to be migrated. SQL Connection Setup: You can easily configure the connection details for your target SQL Server and Database (for example, the endpoint for your Fabric Data Warehouse). Table Mapping: The app lets you review the discovered source files and manually assign a target table name for each file in the new Fabric database. Migration Summary: Before running the migration, it provides a summary of all your settings and mappings for a final check. Getting Started Prerequisites You must have Python version 3.8 or newer installed on your machine. Installation Steps Clone the Project:Get the code from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.gitcd your-repo-name Use a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):Create and activate an isolated environment for your project dependencies: python -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate (for macOS/Linux)venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows) Install Necessary Libraries:Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content (you may need to install a specific SQL connector like pyodbc or another library like pandas if your script uses it for data manipulation): streamlitpyodbcpandas Then, install them:pip install -r requirements.txt How to Use the Tool Running the Application Start the web app from your terminal:streamlit run Import-DQ_PowerBI_Migration_Tool.py The application will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:8501. Tool Workflow Configuration: Input the required connection details for your target SQL Server and Database (like the connection string for your Fabric Data Warehouse). File Path: Specify the local directory path where your source files (the data or configuration files from Power BI) are located. Map Tables: Go to the "Table Mapping" tab. Here, you will see a list of discovered source files. For each one, you must manually enter the name you want the corresponding target table to have in your Fabric database. Review: Switch to the "Migration Summary" tab to ensure all configurations and file-to-table mappings are correct. Execute: Click the "Run Migration" button to kick off the process.
